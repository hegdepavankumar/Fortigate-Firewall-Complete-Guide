# **II. Configuring Static and Dynamic Routing on FortiGate Firewall**

Routing is a critical function in network devices like FortiGate firewalls, enabling the forwarding of traffic between different networks. Here's a detailed guide on how to configure static and dynamic routing using commands:

## 1. Connect to the FortiGate Firewall

Before configuring routing, establish a connection to the FortiGate firewall using SSH or through the console port directly connected to the firewall device.

```
# Example SSH command to connect to the FortiGate firewall
ssh admin@<firewall_ip_address>

```

## 2. Enter Configuration Mode

Enter configuration mode to make changes to the firewall's configuration. You will need to enter the global configuration context to configure routing.

```
# Enter global configuration mode
config system global

```

## 3. Configure Static Routes

Static routes are manually configured routes that define the next-hop IP address for destinations not directly connected to the firewall.

```
# Example command to configure a static route
config router static
    edit 1
        set dst <destination_network> <subnet_mask>
        set gateway <next_hop_ip_address>
end

```

## 4. Configure Dynamic Routing Protocols

FortiGate firewalls support dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for dynamic route exchange and network convergence.

### 4.1. OSPF Configuration

```
# Example command to configure OSPF
config router ospf
    set router-id <router_id>
    config area
        edit <area_id>
            set network <area_network> <area_subnet_mask>
    end
    config redistribute connected
        set status enable
    end
end

```

### 4.2. BGP Configuration

```
# Example command to configure BGP
config router bgp
    set as <autonomous_system_number>
    config neighbor
        edit <neighbor_ip_address>
            set remote-as <neighbor_as_number>
            set capability-default-originate enabl
    end
end

```

## 5. Verify Routing Configuration

After configuring static and dynamic routing, verify the routing table and routing protocol status to ensure correct configuration.

```
# Example command to view routing table
get router info routing-table

# Example command to view OSPF neighbor status
get router info ospf neighbor

# Example command to view BGP neighbor status
get router info bgp neighbor

```

## 6. Save Configuration Changes

Save the configuration changes to persist them across reboots.

```
# Save configuration
end
```

## 7. Considerations

- **Route Summarization**: Use route summarization to reduce the size of the routing table and optimize routing efficiency.
- **Redundancy**: Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms such as ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) and HA (High Availability) to ensure network availability and reliability.
- **Security Policies**: After configuring routing, create appropriate firewall policies to control traffic flow between networks and enforce security rules.

## **Demo:**

**All the Routing Parts will be available Network Tab Section:**

**To configure dynamic routing protocols like RIPv2, OSPF, BGP**

Steps to configure RIPv2:

- select the required version
- and enter the network/subnet that you want
- if any passive interface or authentication is configured make sure that match the md5 key.
- make sure that the Hello and Hold timers are matching.
- If any redistribute want to do turn on the toggle-specific protocol.

# **III. Configuring DHCP Server Pool for LAN Interface on FortiGate Firewall**

Configuring a DHCP server pool on the LAN interface of a FortiGate firewall allows local users to obtain IP addresses automatically, simplifying network management. Here's a detailed guide on how to configure the DHCP server pool for local users:

## 1. Connect to the FortiGate Firewall

Before configuring DHCP, establish a connection to the FortiGate firewall using SSH or through the console port directly connected to the firewall device.

```
# Example SSH command to connect to the FortiGate firewall
ssh admin@<firewall_ip_address>
```

## 2. Enter Configuration Mode

Enter configuration mode to make changes to the firewall's configuration. You will need to enter the system interface context to configure the LAN interface.

```
# Enter system interface configuration mode
config system interface

```

## 3. Configure LAN Interface

If not already configured, configure the LAN interface with an IP address and subnet mask.

```
# Example command to configure LAN interface
edit <lan_interface_name>
    set ip <ip_address> <subnet_mask>
    set allowaccess ping https ssh
    set dhcp-server enable
    set dhcp-server-option lease-time <lease_time_in_seconds>
    set dhcp-server-option default-gateway <gateway_ip_address>
    set dhcp-server-ip-range <start_ip_address> <end_ip_address>
end

```

- `<lan_interface_name>`: Name of the LAN interface (e.g., "lan").
- `<ip_address>`: IP address of the LAN interface.
- `<subnet_mask>`: Subnet mask of the LAN interface.
- `<lease_time_in_seconds>`: Lease time for IP addresses (in seconds).
- `<gateway_ip_address>`: Default gateway IP address for DHCP clients.
- `<start_ip_address>`: Start IP address of the DHCP IP pool.
- `<end_ip_address>`: End IP address of the DHCP IP pool.

## 4. Configure DNS Server (Optional)

Optionally, configure DNS server settings for DHCP clients.

```
# Example command to configure DNS server for DHCP clients
set dhcp-server-option dns-server <dns_server_ip_address>

```

## 5. Save Configuration Changes

Save the configuration changes to persist them across reboots.

```
# Save configuration
end
```

## 6. Considerations

- **DHCP Lease Time**: Adjust the DHCP lease time based on network requirements and usage patterns.
- **IP Address Range**: Ensure that the DHCP IP address range does not overlap with statically assigned IP addresses or other DHCP pools.
- **DNS Configuration**: Provide accurate DNS server information to DHCP clients for name resolution.
- **Security**: Limit access to DHCP configuration and ensure proper firewall policies are in place to protect the DHCP service from unauthorized access.

## **Demo:**

**To configure the DHCP server go to Network —> Interface —> port2(LAN)**

- enable the DHCP server toggle
- set the IP range by excluding the static IP- to avoid the conflict of IP's
- set the netmask and default gateway as interface IP
- set the DNS server addresses- any
- set the lease time as your requirement
- set apply to save the config.

![Untitled](Fortigate%20Study%20Guide%20v7%20x%20147f58070a3c4e51a249bf2237fd18d0/Untitled%2031.png)

# **IV. FortiGate Firewall: Basic Firewall Policies Configuration and Theory**

Firewall policies on the FortiGate firewall define how traffic is allowed or denied between different network segments. Understanding basic firewall policy configurations and the theory behind rule-by-fault behavior is essential for effective network security. Here's a detailed explanation:

## 1. Firewall Policies Overview

Firewall policies are rules that dictate the flow of traffic through the firewall. Each policy consists of conditions, actions, and security profiles. Policies are evaluated in sequence, and the first matching policy is applied to the traffic.

## 2. Basic Firewall Policy Configuration

### 2.1. Policy Conditions

- **Source and Destination**: Specify the source and destination IP addresses or address groups for the traffic.
- **Service**: Define the protocol and port number or service group used by the traffic.
- **Schedule**: Optionally, restrict when the policy is active based on a defined schedule.
- **Action**: Specify whether the traffic is allowed, denied, or logged.

### 2.2. Policy Actions

- **Accept**: Allow the traffic to pass through the firewall.
- **Deny**: Block the traffic and generate a log entry.
- **Monitor**: Log the traffic but allow it to pass through the firewall.

### 2.3. Security Profiles

- **Antivirus**: Scan files for viruses and malware.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: Detect and prevent network-based attacks.
- **Web Filtering**: Block access to malicious or inappropriate websites.
- **Application Control**: Control access to specific applications and protocols.

## 3. Theory: Rule by Default Behavior

FortiGate firewall follows the rule by default behavior, where traffic that does not match any firewall policy is implicitly denied by default. This behavior ensures that only explicitly permitted traffic is allowed to traverse the firewall, enhancing network security.

## 4. Implicit Deny All Policy

By default, FortiGate firewall includes an implicit "Deny All" policy at the end of the policy list. This policy denies all traffic that does not match any preceding policy. Administrators can modify this behavior by adding specific allow policies above the "Deny All" policy.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Rule Ordering**: Arrange firewall policies from most specific to least specific to ensure that traffic matches the intended policy.
- **Logging**: Enable logging for deny actions to monitor and analyze network traffic effectively.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update firewall policies to adapt to changes in network requirements and security threats.

## 6. Example Configuration

```
config firewall policy
    edit 1
        set srcintf "internal"
        set dstintf "external"
        set srcaddr "all"
        set dstaddr "all"
        set action accept
        set schedule "always"
        set service "ALL"
        set logtraffic all
end
```

## **Demo:**

**To configure policy go to Policy & Objects —> Firewall Policy**

- There will be one by default policy present - Implicit deny
- by clicking create new we can create a new policy on top of Implicit deny.
- It will override the Implicit deny policy.
- For example any traffic does not match with configured policy, it will discards the packet as per the implicit deny policy.

![Untitled](Fortigate%20Study%20Guide%20v7%20x%20147f58070a3c4e51a249bf2237fd18d0/Untitled%2032.png)

**To enable the traffic for LAN —> WAN**

- give the meaningful name for ‘Name’ to identify the purpose of the policy.
- make sure you have selected LAN and WAN interfaces as incoming and outgoing interfaces respectively.
- Source, Destination, and Services set to “all” Initially set it as all, for learning - once you are clear with concepts apply the specific one.
- allow the NAT.
- if you want to see the logs, enable the Log Allowd Traffic. - “All Sessions”
- also, traffic should be allowed on both sides, so we have to configure the reverse Policy inorder to get the communication. WAN —> LAN (only limited access)

# **V. Network Address Translation - Fortigate**

## 1. Theory of NAT (Network Address Translation)

NAT is a technique used to modify network address information in packet headers while in transit through a router or firewall. It serves several purposes, including conserving IP addresses, enabling connectivity between different network types, and enhancing network security by hiding internal IP addresses.

- **Types of NAT**:
    - **Source NAT (SNAT)**: Modifies the source IP address of outgoing packets, typically used for outbound internet access.
    - **Destination NAT (DNAT)**: Modifies the destination IP address of incoming packets, commonly used for inbound services such as web servers or email servers.

## 2. Configuration of NAT on FortiGate Firewall

### 2.1. Static NAT Configuration (1-to-1 NAT)

Static NAT maps a public IP address to a private IP address on a one-to-one basis, allowing external hosts to initiate connections to internal hosts.

```
config firewall ippool
    edit "public_pool"
        set type static
        set address <public_ip_range>
    next
end

config firewall vip
    edit "static_nat"
        set extintf "wan1"
        set extip <public_ip>
        set mappedip <private_ip>
    next
end

```

### 2.2. Port Forwarding Configuration

Port forwarding redirects traffic from a specific port on the firewall's public IP address to an internal IP address and port.

```
config firewall vip
    edit "port_forwarding"
        set extintf "wan1"
        set extip <public_ip>
        set mappedip <private_ip>
        set protocol <protocol>
        set extport <public_port>
        set mappedport <private_port>
    next
end

```

## 3. Static IP Assignment

Assigning a static IP address to a device ensures consistency and predictability in network configurations, particularly for devices requiring consistent access or services.

```
config system interface
    edit <interface_name>
        set ip <ip_address> <subnet_mask>
        set allowaccess <access_options>
    next
end

```

## 4. Interface IP Configuration

Configuring IP addresses on interfaces enables communication between different network segments and defines the gateway for traffic leaving the subnet.

```
config system interface
    edit <interface_name>
        set ip <ip_address> <subnet_mask>
        set allowaccess <access_options>
    next
end

```

## **Demo:**

**By visiting Policy & Objects —> LAN-WAN policy**

- NAT should be enabled.
- Instead of Interface IP —> Use Dynamic IP Pool —> by clicking
- we can able to select the types of NAT we want to perform.
- Overload, One-to-One, Fixed Port Range - choose as per your requirement and apply it.

# **I. Active-Standby(Theory)**

## Hardware Requirements:

1. **Identical FortiGate Models**: Both FortiGate units in the HA cluster must be identical models to ensure compatibility and proper synchronization.
2. **Sufficient Resources**: Ensure that both FortiGate units have adequate CPU, memory, and storage resources to handle the expected network traffic and configurations.
3. **Network Interfaces**: Each FortiGate unit should have the same number and type of network interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, fiber) configured identically.
4. **HA Ports**: Both FortiGate units must have dedicated HA ports available for HA heartbeat communication and synchronization. These ports should be connected via a dedicated HA link cable or network segment.
5. **Power and Cooling**: Ensure that the power supply and cooling systems are sufficient to support both FortiGate units and maintain optimal operating conditions.

## Software Requirements:

1. **Compatible Firmware Versions**: Both FortiGate units must run the same firmware version to ensure compatibility and proper functionality.
2. **HA Licensing**: Ensure that both FortiGate units are licensed for HA features and functionalities. Some HA features may require specific licensing.
3. **Configuration Synchronization**: Configure both FortiGate units with identical network configurations, security policies, routing settings, and HA settings.
4. **Virtual Domains (VDOMs)**: If using VDOMs, ensure that VDOM settings are synchronized between both units and that VDOM HA settings are properly configured.
5. **Monitoring and Management**: Set up monitoring and management tools to monitor the health and status of the HA cluster, including CPU usage, memory utilization, and interface status.

## Network Requirements:

1. **Dedicated HA Link**: Establish a dedicated network link (HA link) between the HA ports of both FortiGate units for heartbeat communication and synchronization.
2. **Redundant Network Connectivity**: Ensure redundant network connectivity for both FortiGate units to prevent single points of failure and ensure continuous operation.
3. **Network Topology**: Configure network routing and VLAN settings to accommodate HA failover events and ensure seamless traffic redirection in case of unit failure.

By meeting these hardware, software, and network requirements, administrators can set up a robust high availability (HA) configuration in the FortiGate firewall to ensure continuous network operation and minimize downtime.

## Active-Standby Theory of FortiGate Firewall with FGCP

Active-standby mode in the FortiGate firewall, facilitated by FGCP (FortiGate Cluster Protocol), is a high availability (HA) configuration where two firewall units operate in tandem. One unit serves as the primary (active) unit, actively processing traffic, while the other unit acts as the secondary (standby) unit, ready to take over in case of failure.

### 1. FGCP (FortiGate Cluster Protocol)

- **Purpose**: FGCP is a proprietary protocol developed by Fortinet for communication and synchronization between firewall units in an HA cluster.
- **Heartbeat and Configuration Sync**: FGCP uses heartbeat signals over the HA link to monitor the status of each unit and synchronize configuration and session information.
- **Failover Control**: FGCP manages failover events, ensuring a seamless transition between active and standby units without disruption to network traffic.
- **Session Pickup**: FGCP enables the standby unit to pick up and continue processing existing sessions from the failed active unit during failover.

### 2. HA Link

- **Dedicated Connection**: The HA link provides a dedicated communication channel between the primary and secondary firewall units for FGCP communication.
- **Heartbeat Signals**: Heartbeat signals are exchanged over the HA link to monitor the health and availability of each firewall unit in the cluster.
- **Synchronization**: Configuration and session synchronization occur over the HA link to ensure that both units have identical configurations and state information.

### 3. Firewall State

- **Active Unit**: The active unit processes network traffic and maintains firewall state information, including active sessions, NAT translations, and security policies.
- **Standby Unit**: The standby unit remains synchronized with the active unit, mirroring its configuration and firewall state, but does not process traffic.

### 4. Gratuitous ARP (GARP), MAC and IP Swap, Priority

These concepts remain unchanged in the context of FGCP. Gratuitous ARP messages, MAC and IP swap, and priority configurations play crucial roles in ensuring smooth failover and uninterrupted network connectivity during active-standby mode operation with FGCP.

As per our requirement, FGT-1 will be Active, and FGT-2 will be Passive.

- FGT-1 priority is 128 and FGT-2 priority is 100.
- In the Fortigate firewall once synchronization completes we don’t get access to the Passive device.
- Only we can see the status in the Active device

# III. Active-Active Failover in FortiGate Firewall

Active-active failover in FortiGate firewall is a high availability (HA) configuration where both firewall units actively process network traffic simultaneously, distributing the load across the cluster. This configuration enhances performance and ensures redundancy by allowing seamless failover between units in case of hardware or software failures.

## **HA and load balancing**

FGCP active-active HA uses a technique similar to unicast load balancing where the primary unit is associated with the cluster HA virtual MAC addresses and cluster IP addresses. The primary unit is the only cluster unit that receives packets sent to the cluster. The primary unit uses a load-balancing schedule to distribute sessions to all cluster units (including the primary unit). Subordinate unit interfaces retain their actual MAC addresses, and the primary unit communicates with the subordinate units using these MAC addresses. Packets exiting the subordinate units proceed directly to their destination and do not pass through the primary unit.

By default, active-active HA load balancing distributes proxy-based security profile processing to all cluster units. Proxy-based security profile processing is CPU and memory-intensive, so FGCP load balancing may result in higher throughput because resource-intensive processing is distributed among all cluster units.

The following proxy-based security profile processing is load-balanced:

- Virus scanning
- Web filtering
- Email Filtering
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) of HTTP, FTP, IMAP, IMAPS, POP3, POP3S, SMTP, SMTPS, IM, and NNTP sessions accepted by firewall policies

Other features enabled in firewall policies such as endpoint security, traffic shaping, and authentication have no effect on active-active load balancing.

During active-active HA load balancing, the primary unit uses the configured load balancing schedule to determine which cluster unit will process a session. The primary unit stores the load-balancing information for each load-balanced session in the cluster load-balancing session table. Using the information in this table, the primary unit can then forward all of the remaining packets in each session to the appropriate cluster unit. The load balancing session table is synchronized among all cluster units.

ICMP, multicast, and broadcast sessions are never load-balanced and are always processed by the primary unit. The following sessions are only processed by the primary unit:

- IPS
- Application control
- Flow-based virus scanning
- Flow-based web filtering
- Flow-based DLP
- Flow-based email filtering
- VoIP
- IM
- P2P
- IPsec VPN
- SSL VPN
- HTTP multiplexing
- SSL offloading
- WAN optimization
- Explicit web proxy
- WCCP

In addition to load balancing, active-active HA provides the same session, device, and link failover protection as active-passive HA. If the primary unit fails, a subordinate unit becomes the primary unit and resumes operating the cluster. Active-active HA maintains as many load balanced sessions as possible after a failover by continuing to process the load balanced sessions that were being processed by the cluster units that are still operating.

## **Active-active failover**

If a subordinate unit fails, the primary unit redistributes the sessions that the subordinate was processing among the remaining active cluster members. If the primary unit fails, the subordinate units negotiate to select a new primary unit. The new primary unit continues to distribute packets among the remaining active cluster units.

Failover works similarly if the cluster consists of only two units. If the primary unit fails, the subordinate unit negotiates and becomes the new primary unit. If the subordinate unit fails, the primary unit processes all traffic. In both cases, the single remaining unit continues to function as a primary unit, maintaining the HA virtual MAC address for all of its interfaces.

## 2. Configuration

### 2.1. HA Configuration

- **Enable HA**: Configure active-active HA mode on both firewall units.
- **Synchronize Configuration**: Ensure that both units have identical configurations, including network interfaces, routing, and security policies.
- **Configure Load Balancing**: Define load-balancing algorithms and link load-balancing settings to distribute traffic evenly across the cluster.

### 2.2. Firewall Policies

# **Module 7: Basic IPSEC VPN**

Table of contents:

- Understanding the Architecture of IPSEC
- Understanding IKE Phase 1 & 2
- Configure IPSEC between FortiGate to FortiGate

# **I. Understanding the Architecture of IPsec**

IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is a suite of protocols used to secure Internet protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session. The architecture of IPsec involves several components and protocols working together to establish secure communication channels. Here's a detailed overview of the IPsec architecture:

## 1. Security Associations (SA)

- **Purpose**: Security Associations define the parameters for secure communication between two devices, including authentication and encryption algorithms, keys, and security parameters.
- **Components**: Each SA consists of a pair of security parameters index (SPI), source IP address, destination IP address, security protocol (AH or ESP), and security parameters such as encryption and authentication algorithms.

## 2. Security Associations Database (SAD)

- **Purpose**: The Security Associations Database stores active SAs negotiated between IPsec peers, allowing the system to quickly look up the parameters required to process inbound and outbound IPsec packets.
- **Components**: SAD contains entries for each active SA, including SPI, source and destination IP addresses, security protocol, encryption/authentication keys, and lifetime information.

## 3. Key Management Protocol

- **Purpose**: Key Management Protocols are used to negotiate and manage encryption keys required for establishing secure communication channels between IPsec peers.
- **Protocols**: Common Key Management Protocols include Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and IKEv2, which automate the negotiation and exchange of encryption keys, authentication parameters, and security policies.

## 4. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

- **Purpose**: ESP provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for IP packets by encapsulating the payload in a secure envelope, encrypting it, and adding authentication data.
- **Functions**: ESP encrypts the IP payload using encryption algorithms such as AES or 3DES, adds authentication data to ensure packet integrity, and optionally provides anti-replay protection.

## 5. Authentication Header (AH)

- **Purpose**: AH provides data integrity, authentication, and anti-replay protection for IP packets by including a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) in each packet.
- **Functions**: AH calculates a hash-based authentication code over the IP packet's entire contents, including the IP header, ensuring the integrity of the packet and detecting any modifications.

# **II. Understanding IKE Phase 1 & 2**

IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is a key management protocol used in IPsec VPNs to establish and manage secure communication channels between peers. IKE operates in two phases, known as Phase 1 and Phase 2, each serving distinct purposes in the VPN establishment process. Let's delve into the details of each phase:

## 1. IKE Phase 1

- **Purpose**: Phase 1 establishes a secure channel for negotiating the parameters required for subsequent communications, including encryption algorithms, authentication methods, and session keys.
- **Main Mode Exchange**: Phase 1 typically employs Main Mode exchange, where peers authenticate each other and exchange encryption keys securely.
- **Components**:
    - **Authentication**: Peers authenticate each other using pre-shared keys (PSK) or digital certificates to ensure mutual trust.
    - **Diffie-Hellman (DH) Exchange**: Peers perform a DH key exchange to generate a shared secret used to derive encryption keys.
    - **Encryption and Integrity**: Phase 1 negotiates encryption and integrity algorithms to protect subsequent IKE and IPsec communications.
- **Parameters Negotiated**: IKE Phase 1 negotiates parameters such as encryption algorithm, authentication method, DH group, and session lifetime.

## 2. IKE Phase 2

- **Purpose**: Phase 2 establishes security associations (SAs) for IPsec traffic, defining the parameters for encrypting and authenticating data packets exchanged between peers.
- **Quick Mode Exchange**: Phase 2 typically uses Quick Mode exchange, which focuses on negotiating IPsec parameters efficiently.
- **Components**:
    - **Encryption and Authentication**: Phase 2 negotiates encryption and authentication algorithms specifically for IPsec traffic protection.
    - **IPsec SA Establishment**: Peers establish one or more IPsec SAs, each defining the parameters for encrypting and authenticating data packets.
    - **Traffic Selector Negotiation**: Peers agree on which traffic will be protected by IPsec, defining source and destination IP addresses and protocols.
- **Parameters Negotiated**: IKE Phase 2 negotiates parameters such as encryption algorithm, authentication method, IPsec mode (tunnel or transport), and IPsec SAs.

## 

# **III. Configuring IPsec between FortiGate to FortiGate**

IPsec VPNs provide secure communication between networks or devices over the internet by encrypting and authenticating data traffic. Configuring IPsec between FortiGate firewalls involves several steps to establish a secure VPN tunnel. Here's a detailed guide:

## 1. Pre-requisites

- Ensure both FortiGate firewalls have valid licenses for IPsec VPN.
- Determine the public IP addresses of both FortiGate firewalls.
- Establish connectivity between the public IP addresses of the two FortiGate firewalls.

## 2. Configure Phase 1 (IKE)

### On FortiGate A:

- Navigate to **VPN > IPsec > Wizard**.
- Select **Custom VPN Tunnel (No Template)** and click **Next**.
- Enter a **Name** for the VPN tunnel and click **Next**.
- Configure Phase 1 parameters:
    - **Remote Gateway**: Public IP address of FortiGate B.
    - **Authentication Method**: Pre-shared Key or Digital Certificate.
    - **Pre-shared Key**: Enter a shared secret for authentication.
    - **Encryption Algorithm**: Select desired encryption algorithm.
    - **Authentication Algorithm**: Select desired authentication algorithm.
    - **Diffie-Hellman Group**: Select DH group for key exchange.
- Click **Next** and then **Finish**.

### On FortiGate B:

- Repeat the same steps as above, configuring Phase 1 parameters with the public IP address of FortiGate A.

## 3. Configure Phase 2

### On FortiGate A:

- Navigate to **VPN > IPsec > Wizard**.
- Select **Custom VPN Tunnel (No Template)** and click **Next**.
- Enter the same **Name** used for Phase 1 and click **Next**.
- Configure Phase 2 parameters:
    - **Remote Gateway**: Public IP address of FortiGate B.
    - **Local Interface**: Select the outgoing interface.
    - **Encryption Algorithm**: Select the encryption algorithm.
    - **Authentication Algorithm**: Select the authentication algorithm.
    - **PFS**: Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy if required.
- Click **Next** and then **Finish**.

### On FortiGate B:

- Repeat the same steps as above, configuring Phase 2 parameters with the public IP address of FortiGate A.

## 4. Verify and Monitor

- Once Phase 1 and Phase 2 configurations are completed on both FortiGate firewalls, the VPN tunnel should be established automatically.
- Navigate to **VPN > Monitor > IPsec Monitor** to verify the status of the VPN tunnel.
- Monitor traffic and logs to ensure the proper functioning of the IPsec VPN tunnel.
